The CORE Political Typology

Political Attitudes, Not Ideologies

The CORE model maps political outlooks using four cognitive dimensions rather than party or ideology.
It helps people see that disagreements often come from attitudes and worldview differences — not morality or intelligence.

## What is CORE?

**CORE** stands for:
- **C**ivil Rights (Liberty ↔ Authority)
- **O**penness (Global ↔ National)
- **R**edistribution (Market ↔ Social)
- **E**thics (Progressive ↔ Traditional)

The CORE framework is part of **Squares**, a visual political mapping system. Each person or movement gets four colors representing their CORE scores, displayed as square emojis for instant visual recognition.

## Scoring System

Each dimension uses a **0-5 scale**:
- **0-2**: Low end of spectrum (Liberty, Global, Market, Progressive)
- **3-5**: High end of spectrum (Authority, National, Social, Traditional)

### Visual Color Coding
🟪 **0 = Purple** | 🟦 **1 = Blue** | 🟩 **2 = Green** | 🟨 **3 = Yellow** | 🟧 **4 = Orange** | 🟥 **5 = Red**

**Example: LGSP with scores (1, 2, 4, 0)**
- C = 1 (Liberty) → 🟦
- O = 2 (Global) → 🟩
- R = 4 (Social) → 🟧
- E = 0 (Progressive) → 🟪

**Visual: 🟦🟩🟧🟪** represents a progressive globalist with moderate civil liberties preference and a preference for social welfare.

🧭 The Four CORE Dimensions

Each person answers a set of yes/no toggles.
More YES answers = higher value on that dimension (0–5 scale).

| Dimension | Low (0-2) | High (3-5) | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Civil Rights (C)** | **Liberty**: favors autonomy, free speech, decentralization | **Authority**: favors coordination, order, rules | Trust in institutions vs individuals |
| **Openness (O)** | **Global**: open borders, trade, cosmopolitan curiosity | **National**: rooted identity, protection of local culture | Comfort with change and difference |
| **Redistribution (R)** | **Market**: individual effort, voluntary exchange | **Social**: collective welfare, safety nets | How we balance autonomy and fairness |
| **Ethics (E)** | **Progressive**: equality, moral flexibility | **Traditional**: hierarchy, moral structure | Preferred moral framework |

### Score Interpretation
- **C: Liberty (0-2) ↔ Authority (3-5)**
- **O: Global (0-2) ↔ National (3-5)**
- **R: Market (0-2) ↔ Social (3-5)**
- **E: Progressive (0-2) ↔ Traditional (3-5)**

🔘 The Eight Toggle Tags (Simplified Questionnaire)

Each dimension uses two yes/no questions (eight total).
Each “YES” raises that axis score by one point.

1. Civil Liberties (L/A)
	•	✅ Should government have strong powers to regulate harmful or false speech online?
	•	✅ Should police and security agencies have expanded tools for surveillance and data collection?

2. Openness (G/N)
	•	✅ Should immigration be limited to protect national culture and jobs?
	•	✅ Should trade barriers be raised to favor domestic industry?

3. Redistribution (M/S)
	•	✅ Should the government guarantee universal healthcare and a living wage?
	•	✅ Should large companies share profits or decision-making with workers?

4. Ethics (P/T)
	•	✅ Should abortion or same-sex marriage be legally restricted to preserve traditional values?
	•	✅ Should businesses and schools be allowed to follow their religious or cultural rules even if discriminatory?

Add your YES answers → plot the scores (0–5 each).
Combine the letters from your results (e.g., LGSP) to reveal your political attitude.

🧠 How to Read Your CORE Type

Example: LGSP (Diplomat)
	•	L – Liberty: favors free expression and light policing.
	•	G – Global: open to trade and migration.
	•	S – Social: supports welfare and collective solutions.
	•	P – Progressive: emphasizes equality over tradition.

That person is an empathetic, cooperative global reformer — the Diplomat family.

📊 Dimensional Importance by Type

Each attitude type has **7 points** distributed across the four CORE dimensions, indicating which dimensions most strongly define that attitude. Each dimension receives at least 1 point.

**Reading the Visual Representations:**
- **Binary**: ⬜️ = less government (Liberty/Global/Market/Progressive), ⬛️ = more government (Authority/National/Social/Traditional)
- **Mid-Value**: Simplified color coding where 🟦 = L/G/M/P (blue for less government) and 🟧 = A/N/S/T (orange for more government)

*Example: AGSP (Technocrats) shows ⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️ in binary and 🟧🟦🟧🟦 in mid-value, indicating Authority-Global-Social-Progressive preferences.*

💬 The CORE Idea

People differ less in goals than in cognitive temperament:
	•	Builders trust freedom to innovate.
	•	Diplomats trust cooperation to heal.
	•	Unionists trust solidarity to protect.
	•	Proprietors trust community to preserve.

Seeing politics this way turns conflict into conversation —
from “who’s right” to “how do we think differently?”
