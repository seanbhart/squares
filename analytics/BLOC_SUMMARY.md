# Political Bloc Configuration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes 13 distinct political blocs across the ideological spectrum, from communists to fascists. Each bloc is defined by its positions on five key policy dimensions.

## Dimension Key
All blocs are scored 0-6 on five dimensions:

| Dimension | 0 (Liberal/Open) | 6 (Conservative/Closed) |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Trade** | Free trade/globalist | Protectionist/nationalist |
| **Abortion** | Pro-choice | Pro-life |
| **Migration** | Open borders | Closed borders/restrictive |
| **Economics** | Free market/laissez-faire | Heavy intervention/planning |
| **Rights** | Progressive individualism | Traditional/communitarian |

## Visual Spectrum Legend
🟪 Purple (0) → 🟦 Blue (1) → 🟩 Green (2) → 🟨 Yellow (3) → 🟧 Orange (4) → 🟥 Red (5) → ⬛️ Dark Slate (6)

## Key Dimensions Explained

Each bloc is defined by **three key dimensions** listed in order of importance. These represent the policy areas that most strongly define the bloc's ideological identity and distinguish it from other blocs.

**How to interpret:**
- **First dimension** = Most defining characteristic of the bloc
- **Second dimension** = Secondary defining characteristic
- **Third dimension** = Tertiary defining characteristic

**Key Dimension Colors** show the emoji square for each of these three dimensions, providing a visual summary of the bloc's core positions.

**Example:** Communists have key dimensions of Economics (⬛️), Rights (🟥), Trade (⬛️) - meaning their ideology is primarily defined by maximum state economic control, followed by communitarian/authoritarian rights positions, and protectionist trade policy.

**Pattern observations:**
- **Left-wing blocs (1-6)** typically prioritize Economics first
- **Right-wing blocs (10-13)** typically prioritize Migration or Rights first
- **Centrist/libertarian blocs (7-9)** show more varied priorities based on their specific coalition

## Discussion Questions

1. **Bloc Coherence:** Do the key dimensions for each bloc accurately capture their core ideological commitments?

2. **Real-World Representation:** Are the example figures/movements appropriately categorized? Any notable omissions?

3. **Spectrum Positioning:** Do the numerical scores (0-6) accurately reflect the relative positions of different blocs on each dimension?

4. **Missing Blocs:** Are there significant political movements/ideologies not represented in this 13-bloc system?

5. **Reference Ideologies:** Six blocs are marked as "reference ideologies" (Communists, Revolutionary Socialists, Nordic Model, Libertarian Lobby, Localist League, Fascists). Do these serve as effective anchor points for the spectrum?

6. **Playability:** All blocs are marked as "not playable" - what criteria should determine which blocs become playable in the game context?

7. **Key Dimensions Priority:** Each bloc has 3 "key dimensions" that define them. Are these the right prioritizations?

8. **Modern Political Shifts:** How might recent political developments (2020-2025) require adjustments to these classifications?

---

## Technical Notes

- All blocs are currently marked as **not playable**
- **6 Reference Ideologies** serve as theoretical anchor points for the spectrum
- Color coding uses a 7-color ramp from purple (most liberal) to dark slate (most extreme/authoritarian)
- Each bloc has exactly **3 key dimensions** that most strongly define their identity
- Scores range from **0 (most liberal/open/progressive)** to **6 (most conservative/closed/traditional)**

2. Add Speech/Platform Regulation as 6th dimension
3. Add Gun Rights as cultural/rights marker
4. Split Rights into Civil Rights vs Individual Liberties
