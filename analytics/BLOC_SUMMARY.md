# Political Bloc Configuration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes 13 distinct political blocs across the ideological spectrum, from communists to fascists. Each bloc is defined by its positions on **eight PLATFORM policy dimensions**.

## PLATFORM Framework
All blocs are scored 0-6 on eight dimensions:

| Dimension | 0 (Liberal/Open) | 6 (Conservative/Closed) |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Privacy** | Maximum privacy protections | Maximum surveillance state |
| **Labor** | Anti-union, right-to-work | Maximum labor power, codetermination |
| **Abortion** | Pro-choice | Pro-life |
| **Trade** | Free trade | Protectionist |
| **Free Speech** | Absolute free speech | Maximum speech restrictions |
| **Ownership** | Pure private ownership | Full state ownership |
| **Rights** | Progressive individualism (anti-discrimination) | Traditional/communitarian (pro-discrimination) |
| **Migration** | Open borders | Closed borders |

**Scoring Methodology:** Scores are based on **historical practice** rather than stated ideology (e.g., Communists score high on border restrictions despite internationalist rhetoric).

## Visual Spectrum Legend
🟪 Purple (0) → 🟦 Blue (1) → 🟩 Green (2) → 🟨 Yellow (3) → 🟧 Orange (4) → 🟥 Red (5) → ⬛️ Black (6)

**Special Note:** The **Rights** dimension uses a horseshoe color scheme (⬛️🟥🟧🟨🟧🟥⬛️) because both extremes involve heavy government intervention—0-2 enforces anti-discrimination, 4-6 enforces traditional hierarchies, and 3 is neutral/hands-off.

## PLATFORM Framework Scores

The PLATFORM framework measures 8 key policy dimensions across all blocs. Scores range from 0-6 on each dimension.

**Scoring Methodology:** Scores are based on **historical practice** rather than stated ideology. For example, Communists score high on border restrictions (Berlin Wall, Soviet exit visas) despite internationalist rhetoric, and both Communists and Fascists score maximum on surveillance despite different ideological justifications.

### Dimension Definitions

## Discussion Questions

1. **Bloc Coherence:** Do the key dimensions for each bloc accurately capture their core ideological commitments?

2. **Real-World Representation:** Are the example figures/movements appropriately categorized? Any notable omissions?

3. **Spectrum Positioning:** Do the numerical scores (0-6) accurately reflect the relative positions of different blocs on each dimension?

4. **Missing Blocs:** Are there significant political movements/ideologies not represented in this 13-bloc system?

5. **Reference Ideologies:** Six blocs are marked as "reference ideologies" (Communists, Revolutionary Socialists, Nordic Model, Libertarian Lobby, Localist League, Fascists). Do these serve as effective anchor points for the spectrum?

6. **Playability:** All blocs are marked as "not playable" - what criteria should determine which blocs become playable in the game context?

7. **Key Dimensions Priority:** Each bloc has 3 "key dimensions" that define them. Are these the right prioritizations?

8. **Modern Political Shifts:** How might recent political developments (2020-2025) require adjustments to these classifications?

## Technical Notes

- All blocs are currently marked as **not playable**
- **6 Reference Ideologies** serve as theoretical anchor points for the spectrum: Communists, Revolutionary Socialists, Nordic Model, Libertarian Lobby, Localist League, and Fascists
- Color coding uses a 7-color ramp from purple (most liberal) to black (most extreme/authoritarian)
- The **PLATFORM framework** uses **8 dimensions**: Privacy, Labor, Abortion, Trade, Free Speech, Ownership, Rights, and Migration
- Scores range from **0 (liberal/open/minimal state)** to **6 (conservative/closed/maximal state)**
- **Rights dimension** uses a unique horseshoe color scheme because both extremes involve heavy government intervention
