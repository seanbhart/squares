## Additional Recommendations

### Technical Improvements
1. **Create explicit CORE assessment flow** - Let users answer CORE-specific questions rather than relying only on the grid selector
2. **Implement user accounts** - Enable saving results, tracking changes over time, and social features
3. **Add "confidence" indicator** - Show users how strongly they lean on each dimension
4. **Build comparison features** - Side-by-side comparison with figures or friends

### Content Improvements
1. **BLOC type deep dives** - Create detailed pages for each of the 16 BLOC types
2. **"Day in the life" scenarios** - Show how different CORE positions manifest in real policy preferences
3. **Historical context** - Add more historical figures from diverse eras and regions

### Growth Opportunities
1. **Farcaster-native features** - Leverage Farcaster's social graph for "friends who are similar"
2. **Embed partnerships** - Reach out to political news sites for embedding
3. **Educational partnerships** - Civics education contexts

## Appendix: Migration Reference

### TAMER to CORE Conversion Logic
For auto-converted scores (when users haven't explicitly set CORE):

| CORE Dimension | Formula |
|----------------|---------|
| Civil Rights | `avg(rights, abortion)` scaled 0-6 → 0-5 |
| Openness | `avg(migration, trade)` scaled 0-6 → 0-5 |
| Redistribution | `economics` scaled 0-6 → 0-5 |
| Ethics | `weighted_avg(abortion×0.6, rights×0.4)` scaled 0-6 → 0-5 |

### Key Files Reference
- Core config: `lib/core-config.ts`
- BLOC config: `lib/bloc-config.ts`
- Converter: `lib/tamer-to-core-converter.ts`
- Historical figures (CORE): `data/figures_core.json`
- Historical figures (TAMER - legacy): `data/figures.json`
- Migration SQL: `supabase/migrations/20250221_populate_core_from_tamer.sql`
- Tests: `__tests__/` directory (104 unit tests)
