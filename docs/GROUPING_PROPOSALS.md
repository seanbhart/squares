# Common Ground Grouping Proposals

**Purpose**: Create overlapping group definitions to help users find others who share positions on one or more dimensions, regardless of their positions on other dimensions. These groups enable community building, recommendations, and discovering unexpected alignments.

**Key Principles**:
- People can belong to multiple groups (overlapping definitions)
- Some dimensions require tighter boundaries (abortion extremes, migration/economics 6s)
- Some allow wider ranges (trade, centrist economics)
- Focus on common ground, not comprehensive profiles
- Avoid partisan labels - use descriptive terms based on intervention levels
- Consider cross-dimensional affinities that transcend typical political categories

---

## Grouping Strategy Categories

### 1. Single-Dimension Affinity Groups
Groups based on shared positions on ONE dimension, allowing diversity on all others.

### 2. Two-Dimension Coalition Groups
Specific combinations of TWO dimensions that create meaningful common ground.

### 3. Consistency Pattern Groups
Groups based on overall patterns (all low intervention, all high intervention, mixed).

### 4. Issue-Specific Pragmatist Groups
People who cluster around centrist/moderate positions on specific issues.

### 5. Cross-Cutting Alliance Groups
Unexpected combinations that transcend typical political alignments.

## 7. Dimension-Specific Recommendations

### Tight Grouping Required (1-2 point range max)

**Abortion Extremes**
- Position 0: Maximum 0-1 group
- Position 6: Maximum 5-6 group
- Rationale: These represent deeply held convictions with little tolerance for deviation

**Migration Extreme**
- Position 6: Isolate as single point
- Rationale: "No immigration" is extreme position

**Economics Extreme**
- Position 6: Isolate as single point
- Rationale: "Full state control" is extreme position

### Moderate Grouping Acceptable (2-3 point range)

**Abortion Middle**
- Positions 2-4 can coexist
- Rationale: Evidence-based frameworks have some flexibility

**Migration Middle**
- Positions 2-4 can coexist
- Rationale: Practical immigration policy allows variation

**Economics Middle**
- Positions 2-4 can coexist
- Rationale: Mixed economy has gradual spectrum

**Rights Moderate**
- Positions 2-4 can coexist
- Rationale: Balancing equality and tradition has gradual spectrum

### Wide Grouping Acceptable (3-4 point range)

**Trade Policy**
- Positions 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 all reasonable
- Rationale: Least emotionally charged dimension, most room for practical debate

**Economics Lower**
- Positions 0-2 can span range
- Rationale: Free market spectrum allows variation in safety net

## Implementation Recommendations

### Dropdown Organization

**Tier 1: Single-Dimension Groups** (15-20 groups)
- Easiest to understand
- Clearest common ground
- Show count of matching users

**Tier 2: Two-Dimension Coalitions** (20-30 groups)
- More specific common ground
- Creative combinations
- Helps find nuanced alignments

**Tier 3: Pattern-Based Groups** (8-12 groups)
- Consistency clusters
- Ideological profiles
- Helps find similar overall worldviews

**Tier 4: Color Pattern Groups** (15-18 groups)
- Visual color themes and combinations
- Easy to understand at a glance
- Helps users identify by overall tendency
- Appeals to visual thinkers

**Tier 5: Cross-Cutting Alliances** (12-15 groups)
- Unexpected common ground
- Issue-specific focus
- Helps break echo chambers

### User Experience

**Selection Interface**:
- Multi-select dropdown
- Show user's qualifying groups automatically
- Display match count for each group
- Allow filtering by number of dimensions matched

**Results Display**:
- Sort by number of shared dimensions
- Highlight which dimensions create the match
- Show diversity of other dimensions (to show variety within group)
- Suggest related groups user might also identify with

**Recommendation Engine**:
- Weight recent groups user has explored
- Suggest "nearby" groups (differ by 1 dimension)
- Highlight unexpected matches
- Show "opposite" groups for perspective-taking

### Technical Considerations

**Overlapping Membership**:
- User can belong to 15-30 groups simultaneously
- Store as computed field or calculate on-demand
- Index on common groups for performance

**Dynamic Descriptions**:
- Generate group descriptions showing score ranges
- Show example profiles within each group
- Update counts in real-time

**Privacy**:
- Only show groups with minimum threshold of members (e.g., 5+)
- Don't expose individual profiles through group membership
- Allow users to opt out of being recommended

---

## Conclusion

This grouping framework creates **75-95 overlapping groups** that:
1. Respect the intensity of certain positions (abortion/migration/economics extremes)
2. Allow flexibility where topics are less divisive (trade, centrist positions)
3. Create unexpected alliances across dimensions
4. **Identify visual color patterns that indicate overall political tendencies**
5. Help users find common ground even when they differ on other issues
6. Avoid partisan labels in favor of descriptive, intervention-based language
7. Enable rich recommendation and community-building features

The key insight is that **common ground exists on single issues even when people disagree on everything else**. By creating many overlapping groups, we help users discover allies they might not expect, build coalitions across traditional divides, and recognize the complexity of political identity beyond simple left-right categorization.

**The Color Pattern Groups are particularly powerful** because they make abstract political positions immediately visible and intuitive. Users can quickly see "I'm mostly green and yellow" or "I have green economics but red social views" and find others with similar visual patterns. This adds an accessible, engaging layer to political self-identification that complements the more analytical single and two-dimension groups.
