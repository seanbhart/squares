# Squares CORE Framework Launch: Marketing Plan

> **Created:** January 2025
> **Status:** Ready for Execution
> **Mission:** Help people understand each other's political stances better and reduce extremist views of opposing positions

---

## Executive Summary

Squares is transitioning from the TAMER framework (5 dimensions) to CORE (4 dimensions) - a more intuitive, memorable political values assessment. The CORE framework's elegance (one letter per dimension forming a 4-letter "call sign") creates significant viral potential.

**Key Strategic Insight:** Position CORE as a bridge-building tool, not another divisive political quiz. The goal is understanding, not judgment.

## 2. Messaging Framework

### Core Value Proposition

**Primary:** "Your politics are not one word. CORE maps your political identity across four independent dimensions, giving you a 4-letter call sign that captures how you actually think—not what team you're supposed to be on."

### By Audience Segment

| Segment | Lead Message | Hook |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Politically Frustrated | "Tired of being boxed in? Left and right are broken." | CORE shows where you actually stand |
| Politically Curious | "What if you could see your political DNA?" | Four letters that are uniquely you |
| Bridge-Builders | "Understanding starts with seeing." | Where you might find common ground |
| Crypto-Native | "Governance matters." | Understand your priors before you vote |

### Response to Common Objections

**"This is just another political compass."**
> "Political compasses use two axes. CORE uses four independent dimensions and 16 distinct profiles. We measure through real scenarios, not abstract agreement scales."

**"Why should I trust this?"**
> "CORE is built on political science research. We measure trade-offs, not tribal signals. And we show you the reasoning—transparency over authority."

**"What if I'm in the middle on everything?"**
> "Then your call sign reflects that. Moderate positions are valid. We show intensity as well as direction."

**"Isn't this just labeling people differently?"**
> "Labels simplify. CORE shows complexity. Your 4-letter code isn't meant to box you in—it's meant to start conversations."

Who are they? What's their call sign?
```

**Reveal:**

## 5. Partnerships & Outreach

### Farcaster Channels

**Primary:**
- `/politics` - Core audience
- `/philosophy` - Intellectual discussion
- `/governance` - DAO voters
- `/builders` - Product angle

**Secondary:**
- `/farcaster` - General reach
- `/degen` - Meme potential
- `/base` - Crypto-native politically engaged

### Channel Strategy

1. Request permission to post educational CORE content
2. Offer channel-specific analysis ("The CORE of /builders")
3. Create weekly discussion threads
4. Host AMAs in relevant channels

### Influencer Outreach Template

```
Hey [Name],

I'm launching a new version of Squares that I think your audience would find interesting.

Instead of left/right, it maps political identity across 4 dimensions (think Myers-Briggs for politics). Users get a 4-letter "call sign" that captures their views on civil rights, globalization, economics, and social values.

Would you be open to trying it and sharing your call sign? Happy to do a custom comparison with historical figures too.

[link to assessment]
```

### Community Building

1. **Bloc-Based Communities** - Informal "bloc clubs" for each family
2. **Ambassador Program** - Power users from each bloc
3. **User-Generated Content** - RT/QT users sharing call signs
4. **Rituals** - "Sunday CORE" reflection, "Guess the Figure Friday"

---

## 6. Reducing Polarization Messaging

### Core Narrative

"CORE doesn't tell you who's right or wrong. It shows you why people disagree—and where they might find common ground."

### Key Messages

1. **"Disagreement is dimensional."**
   You might disagree on economics but agree on civil liberties. Traditional labels hide this.

2. **"Understanding before judgment."**
   When you know someone is ANMT, you understand their priors. You can disagree with conclusions while understanding values.

3. **"16 types, infinite conversations."**
   Every call sign represents a coherent worldview. None are inherently good or bad.

4. **"Your opposite isn't your enemy."**
   Find someone with the opposite CORE. Talk to them. You'll disagree on methods but might share goals.

### Cross-Spectrum Messaging

| Leaning | Message |
|---------|---------|
| Liberty | "CORE doesn't judge. Whether you value individual freedom or collective security, your position is valid." |
| Authority | "Social order matters. CORE recognizes that some people prioritize stability and institutions." |
| Global | "International cooperation has solved problems no nation could alone." |
| National | "National identity and sovereignty matter. CORE doesn't pathologize prioritizing your community." |
| Market | "Markets have lifted billions from poverty. CORE shows how your economic philosophy connects to your broader worldview." |
| Social | "Collective action solves collective problems. CORE recognizes redistribution as an expression of values about fairness." |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Cross-bloc reply rate | >30% of threads | Shows dialogue happening |
| "Opposite" feature usage | 25% of completers | Curiosity about other perspectives |
| Negative sentiment | <10% | People feel seen, not judged |
| Return visits after dialogue | +50% vs. solo | Engagement drives retention |

## Conclusion

The CORE transition is an opportunity to relaunch Squares with a more shareable, memorable product. The 4-letter call sign creates natural virality, while the improved framework better serves the mission of reducing polarization through understanding.

**Success = Adoption + Virality + Dialogue + Retention**

The Farcaster community is the ideal launch audience: politically engaged, comfortable with novel frameworks, and active sharers. A strong launch here builds momentum for broader expansion.
